# `glab release create`

Create a new or update a GitLab Release for a repository

## Synopsis

Create a new or update a GitLab Release for a repository.

If the release already exists, glab updates the release with the new info provided.

If a Git tag specified does not yet exist, the release will automatically get created
from the latest state of the default branch and tagged with the specified tag name.
Use `--ref` to override this.
The `ref` can be a commit SHA, another tag name, or a branch name.
To fetch the new tag locally after the release, do `git fetch --tags origin`.

To create a release from an annotated Git tag, first create one locally with
Git, push the tag to GitLab, then run this command.

Developer level access to the project is required to create a release.

```plaintext
glab release create <tag> [<files>...] [flags]
```

$ glab release create v1.0.1 '/path/to/asset.zip#My display label'

Upload a release asset with a display name and type
$ glab release create v1.0.1 '/path/to/asset.png#My display label#image'

Upload all assets in a specified folder (types will default to 'other')
$ glab release create v1.0.1 ./dist/*

Upload all tarballs in a specified folder (types will default to 'other')
$ glab release create v1.0.1 ./dist/*.tar.gz
