The docs for all commands including new commands are automatically generated. Do not change any file in this folder.

Just add the commands and the docs will be generated

## Generating the Docs

If you add a new command or update the existing information for a command you need to generate the doc updates in your merge request. To generate the docs run the following command from the project directory:

```shell
make gen-docs
```
